# group-project-1
Uses HTML, Foundation (CSS), and Javascript to create an app that allows uses to search for a National Park, activities available, and nearby restaurants and accomodations. 
There is a looping video background on the landing page. 
User enters the name of the park, the menu offers autocomplete, then the user can choose to be offered information on activities available in the park, restaurants, or accomodations.
Relevant information, including full name of the parks, the activities available in each, and latitiude and longitude are saved in local storage.
App uses two API's: HTTPS://developer.nps.gov and HTTPS://api.yelp.com.

Created as a group project.
Challenges included compressing the video while maintaining clarity, having to substitute a new API for accomodations, and getting a functional autocomplete menu.
Future expansion would be to improve accessibility, expand search criteria(such being able to search by specific activity), make restaurant and accomodation information clickable links, and polish UI.
